Under the login button should be a some sort of registration button that keeps you on the same page but shows a registration form. When you register it should collect First Name, Last Name, Rank, Unit, Phone Number, Email, Password.

Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Request Form: This form will require pick up location, drop off location, and the number of passengers. There will also be an option block that has “notes” and then a “Submit Request” button. With the pickup location I want a way to automatically use the users current location, but also give them the option to input a manual address. When entering an address it should provide address recommendations like it does on google maps or apple maps as you are typing the address. It should also but able to use location names if its a known business. Once the user has requested the ride it should show a “status” card and remove the request form. This will show them the status of their request such as Pending, Accepted, Driver in Route, Passenger Picked Up, Passenger Dropped Off. Once the passenger gets dropped off it should then hide the “status card” and show a “Review Card”. In this review card it will ask for 1-5 stars. If they choose 4 or 5 stars it should prompt them to submit an ICE Comment which is the following link: https://ice.disa.mil/index.cfm?fa=card&sp=86951&s=360&dep=*DoD if they choose 1-3 stars it should prompt the user to send an email using their default email app to fortwainwrightboss@army.mil. If its possible it should auto populate the Ride ID in the email and the subject should auto populate as SADD Ride Comment “RIDE ID”. If the user reloads the page or leaves and comes back after the ride has completed the review portion should be hidden. Additionally below the request form I want to show the last 3 rides the user had if they had any.\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army. It also should have links to the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer.\n\nTC Page:\n- Navigation Bar: Must include \"SADD\" somewhere a Login button when logged in I want it to display the person's name then provide a drop down when hovered or clicked on that shows \"Profile\" and \"Log Out\". Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Should have a toggle/button that will allow the TC to become “active” and then is assigned a Van. If a van isn’t available then they aren’t able to go “online.” When they go online it should require there location to be shared and have notifications turned on because whenever a task gets assigned to them there should be a push notification sent to the users device. Once they go online there should be a “tasks” card that appears. In this task card it will show them their current task with a button to complete the task. For example when a task gets assigned it will pop up with a button for them to mark that they are “on the way to the passenger.” (This should send a push notification to the rider who requested the ride). Then when they arrive at the location they should be able to click the button for “arrived.” Etc. When they are arrived it should show that passengers information (First and Last Name) and provide a call button to use their native phone app to call the rider to let them know they are there. In this menu before they have pickup the passenger there should be a way to add “walk on passengers” This form would require a first and last name, phone number, and drop off location. This automatically would assign this task to the TC and would reshuffle the mapping of the tasks to ensure an optimized drop off or pickup order. There also should be a button to make the ride as a “no show” and mark the ride as canceled and move on to the next assignment/task. Then once the passenger shows they would click “picked up passenger” and stop to either their next task of picking up the next rider and it would automatically but marked as “enroute.” Its important that they have the information at the right time to be able to map to the rider. Ideally the when they get the map button it uses their native map app to give them directions to where they are going. If they don’t have additional riders to pick up it shows the drop off location with a map button/icon to map them to the drop off location. Once they have dropped off the person they are able to click “Dropped Off Passenger” and it marks the ride as complete. \n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army. It also should have links to the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer.\n\nCoordinator Page:\n- Navigation Bar: Must include \"SADD\" somewhere a Login button when logged in I want it to display the person's name then provide a drop down when hovered or clicked on that shows \"Profile\" and \"Log Out\". Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Live operations card that shows the number of active vans [active vans means the number of vans with an assigned TC who is online], number in progress pickups (this are pickups that are assigned to tc’s, enroute to passenger, passenger picked up), total pickups (this is the number of total pickups that have happened since sadd become active from the button in the admin panel. (On the left side of the screen)\n- Active Fleet card shows the vans that are active. Should include the van name, number of passengers in the van (this is specifically the number of people picked up), TC’s First and Last Name, and include a call button that when clicked it used the user’s native phone app to call the TC. (On the left side of the screen)\n- Live Operations Map: Should show a map from OpenStreetMap that shows a van icon and pickup and drop off destinations.Vans should be colored based on how many passengers they have if (green for low, yellow for middle, red for almost or full). The pickup locations should be blue and the drop off locations should be orange. When you click the van it should show a blue line that follow the roads as if it was directions from each point in the order of tasks.\n- On the right hand side it should have a Smart Assignment card. I want the Smart Assignment system for the SADD dispatcher to work automatically (no button press). It should:\nAuto-assign new requests\nWhen a new ride request comes in, the system should assign it to the most optimal van automatically.\n“Optimal” means minimizing pickup wait time and drop-off detours while respecting vehicle capacity.\nUse insertion-based logic so each new request is tested at different positions in van routes to find the least-cost option.\nHandle walk-ons (driver adds a rider manually)\nWhen a driver adds a walk-on, create a ride record with source='WALK_ON', set state to PICKED_UP, and lock it to that van.\nInsert only the drop-off into the van’s route.\nCapacity should update immediately so future assignments respect it.\nRespect ride “locks” so assignments don’t vanish on drivers\nStates: PENDING → ASSIGNED → EN_ROUTE → PICKED_UP → DROPPED.\nLocks:\nNONE: free to rebalance.\nSOFT: can be rebalanced only if big improvement and driver hasn’t started navigating.\nHARD: never reassign. (Set when driver taps “Navigate” to a pickup OR after pickup happens.)\nRebalancing must only touch rides that are still PENDING or SOFT. Never remove a stop if the driver is already navigating to it or already picked up the passenger.\nPeriodic rebalancing\nEvery 60–120 seconds, recheck pending rides and unassigned requests.\nTry moving pending/unpicked stops between vans if it improves average pickup times without breaking locks.\nIdle vans should reposition to demand hotspots (e.g., centroid of recent ride requests).\nConstraints & defaults\nMax pickup wait: 20 minutes.\nMax detour per rider: 12 minutes.\nCapacity: cannot exceed van seats.\nIf two vans are converging on the same pickup, the one that taps “Navigate” first hard-locks it.\nUI behavior\nDriver sees stops labeled as Queued, Assigned (SOFT), En Route (HARD), or Picked Up.\nTapping Navigate upgrades to En Route (HARD).\nWalk-ons are immediately Picked Up (HARD).\nThe goal: maximize passengers served while keeping average pickup and drop-off times as low as possible, without confusing drivers by yanking tasks that are already en route or picked up.\n\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army. It also should have links to the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer.\n\nAdmin Page:\n- Navigation Bar: Must include \"SADD\" somewhere a Login button when logged in I want it to display the person's name then provide a drop down when hovered or clicked on that shows \"Profile\" and \"Log Out\". Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- On the left hand side I want a “menu” type thing with different sections; Dashboard, Analytics, Users, Fleet. The next 4 sections will include the different “pages” within the admin page, I don’t want to actually load to a different page just show different things on the page when you click each one.\n- Dashboard: This should show general program analytics, Total Pickups,  Average Pickup Times, Average Drop off Times, Cancelation/No show rate, Average Ride Ratings, section should also include the button for making SADD active or inactive which in turn will change the banner on the homepage. Also when SADD is inactive it shouldn’t allow users to submit ride requests. Also you can add anything you think we might need or will be beneficial on the dashboard.\n- Analytics: This section is big. I want to be able to reset the ride information so it resets our overall statistics. This should be protected behind a confirmation popup that requires you to type. “Yes I want to completely reset the ride analytics.” I also want to be able to see total pickups for the year, pickups by month chart, pickups by location chart, average pickup times, average drop off times. It should show what the “hotspots” are. Show when we are “most active” or most likely to receive requests. Im open to other analytics that you think would be good to know because im sure im not thinking of everything. The design of this page is also up to you just make sure everything is logical and easily read. \n- Users: In this section I want to be able to see all my users within the website. I should be able to edit the users, their personal information, account role, and reset their password if needed. Additional there should be a filter/search area at the top. I should be able to search users or filter by role. Ideally this isn’t a forever scroll design instead it should show like 10-25 accounts and then have pages you can go to within it.\n- Fleet: This area will be where you can view and manage your van fleet. When adding to you fleet it should add for a name a total number of passengers. This number does NOT include the staff in the van, it only includes additional the number of pick you can pick up within the vehicle.  You should also be able to edit and delete the vans and put them in different statuses such as forcing them in maintenance which makes it so they can’t be assigned to drivers.\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Request Form: This form will require pick up location, drop off location, and the number of passengers. There will also be an option block that has “notes” and then a “Submit Request” button. With the pickup location I want a way to automatically use the users current location, but also give them the option to input a manual address. When entering an address it should provide address recommendations like it does on google maps or apple maps as you are typing the address. It should also but able to use location names if its a known business. Once the user has requested the ride it should show a “status” card and remove the request form. This will show them the status of their request such as Pending, Accepted, Driver in Route, Passenger Picked Up, Passenger Dropped Off. Once the passenger gets dropped off it should then hide the “status card” and show a “Review Card”. In this review card it will ask for 1-5 stars. If they choose 4 or 5 stars it should prompt them to submit an ICE Comment which is the following link: https://ice.disa.mil/index.cfm?fa=card&sp=86951&s=360&dep=*DoD if they choose 1-3 stars it should prompt the user to send an email using their default email app to fortwainwrightboss@army.mil. If its possible it should auto populate the Ride ID in the email and the subject should auto populate as SADD Ride Comment “RIDE ID”. If the user reloads the page or leaves and comes back after the ride has completed the review portion should be hidden. Additionally below the request form I want to show the last 3 rides the user had if they had any.\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Should have a toggle/button that will allow the TC to become “active” and then is assigned a Van. If a van isn’t available then they aren’t able to go “online.” When they go online it should require there location to be shared and have notifications turned on because whenever a task gets assigned to them there should be a push notification sent to the users device. Once they go online there should be a “tasks” card that appears. In this task card it will show them their current task with a button to complete the task. For example when a task gets assigned it will pop up with a button for them to mark that they are “on the way to the passenger.” (This should send a push notification to the rider who requested the ride). Then when they arrive at the location they should be able to click the button for “arrived.” Etc. When they are arrived it should show that passengers information (First and Last Name) and provide a call button to use their native phone app to call the rider to let them know they are there. In this menu before they have pickup the passenger there should be a way to add “walk on passengers” This form would require a first and last name, phone number, and drop off location. This automatically would assign this task to the TC and would reshuffle the mapping of the tasks to ensure an optimized drop off or pickup order. There also should be a button to make the ride as a “no show” and mark the ride as canceled and move on to the next assignment/task. Then once the passenger shows they would click “picked up passenger” and stop to either their next task of picking up the next rider and it would automatically but marked as “enroute.” Its important that they have the information at the right time to be able to map to the rider. Ideally the when they get the map button it uses their native map app to give them directions to where they are going. If they don’t have additional riders to pick up it shows the drop off location with a map button/icon to map them to the drop off location. Once they have dropped off the person they are able to click “Dropped Off Passenger” and it marks the ride as complete. \n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Live operations card that shows the number of active vans [active vans means the number of vans with an assigned TC who is online], number in progress pickups (this are pickups that are assigned to tc’s, enroute to passenger, passenger picked up), total pickups (this is the number of total pickups that have happened since sadd become active from the button in the admin panel. (On the left side of the screen)\n- Active Fleet card shows the vans that are active. Should include the van name, number of passengers in the van (this is specifically the number of people picked up), TC’s First and Last Name, and include a call button that when clicked it used the user’s native phone app to call the TC. (On the left side of the screen)\n- Live Operations Map: Should show a map from OpenStreetMap that shows a van icon and pickup and drop off destinations.Vans should be colored based on how many passengers they have if (green for low, yellow for middle, red for almost or full). The pickup locations should be blue and the drop off locations should be orange. When you click the van it should show a blue line that follow the roads as if it was directions from each point in the order of tasks.\n- On the right hand side it should have a Smart Assignment card. I want the Smart Assignment system for the SADD dispatcher to work automatically (no button press). It should:\nAuto-assign new requests\nWhen a new ride request comes in, the system should assign it to the most optimal van automatically.\n“Optimal” means minimizing pickup wait time and drop-off detours while respecting vehicle capacity.\nUse insertion-based logic so each new request is tested at different positions in van routes to find the least-cost option.\nHandle walk-ons (driver adds a rider manually)\nWhen a driver adds a walk-on, create a ride record with source='WALK_ON', set state to PICKED_UP, and lock it to that van.\nInsert only the drop-off into the van’s route.\nCapacity should update immediately so future assignments respect it.\nRespect ride “locks” so assignments don’t vanish on drivers\nStates: PENDING → ASSIGNED → EN_ROUTE → PICKED_UP → DROPPED.\nLocks:\nNONE: free to rebalance.\nSOFT: can be rebalanced only if big improvement and driver hasn’t started navigating.\nHARD: never reassign. (Set when driver taps “Navigate” to a pickup OR after pickup happens.)\nRebalancing must only touch rides that are still PENDING or SOFT. Never remove a stop if the driver is already navigating to it or already picked up the passenger.\nPeriodic rebalancing\nEvery 60–120 seconds, recheck pending rides and unassigned requests.\nTry moving pending/unpicked stops between vans if it improves average pickup times without breaking locks.\nIdle vans should reposition to demand hotspots (e.g., centroid of recent ride requests).\nConstraints & defaults\nMax pickup wait: 20 minutes.\nMax detour per rider: 12 minutes.\nCapacity: cannot exceed van seats.\nIf two vans are converging on the same pickup, the one that taps “Navigate” first hard-locks it.\nUI behavior\nDriver sees stops labeled as Queued, Assigned (SOFT), En Route (HARD), or Picked Up.\nTapping Navigate upgrades to En Route (HARD).\nWalk-ons are immediately Picked Up (HARD).\nThe goal: maximize passengers served while keeping average pickup and drop-off times as low as possible, without confusing drivers by yanking tasks that are already en route or picked up.\n\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- On the left hand side I want a “menu” type thing with different sections; Dashboard, Analytics, Users, Fleet. The next 4 sections will include the different “pages” within the admin page, I don’t want to actually load to a different page just show different things on the page when you click each one.\n- Dashboard: This should show general program analytics, Total Pickups,  Average Pickup Times, Average Drop off Times, Cancelation/No show rate, Average Ride Ratings, section should also include the button for making SADD active or inactive which in turn will change the banner on the homepage. Also when SADD is inactive it shouldn’t allow users to submit ride requests. Also you can add anything you think we might need or will be beneficial on the dashboard.\n- Analytics: This section is big. I want to be able to reset the ride information so it resets our overall statistics. This should be protected behind a confirmation popup that requires you to type. “Yes I want to completely reset the ride analytics.” I also want to be able to see total pickups for the year, pickups by month chart, pickups by location chart, average pickup times, average drop off times. It should show what the “hotspots” are. Show when we are “most active” or most likely to receive requests. Im open to other analytics that you think would be good to know because im sure im not thinking of everything. The design of this page is also up to you just make sure everything is logical and easily read. \n- Users: In this section I want to be able to see all my users within the website. I should be able to edit the users, their personal information, account role, and reset their password if needed. Additional there should be a filter/search area at the top. I should be able to search users or filter by role. Ideally this isn’t a forever scroll design instead it should show like 10-25 accounts and then have pages you can go to within it.\n- Fleet: This area will be where you can view and manage your van fleet. When adding to you fleet it should add for a name a total number of passengers. This number does NOT include the staff in the van, it only includes additional the number of pick you can pick up within the vehicle.  You should also be able to edit and delete the vans and put them in different statuses such as forcing them in maintenance which makes it so they can’t be assigned to drivers.\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

I need you to build me one cmd that will build my entire SADD PWA. If you are needing things to be done manual such as adding in the cloud flare tunnel key then do as much as you can in the one command give explicit instructions on what I need to do then continue with another one cmd to complete the project. I will be self hosting it on a Ubuntu LTS Server that is locally hosted and will need to use cloudflare tunnel due to using Starlink for my WiFi. All passwords should be auto generated when possible, then show me where I can go get those passwords from, unless it’s something you can generate like the cloud flare tunnel one you’ll need. Below will be the additional instructions, site map, functions of each page and the website, and instructions for UI/UX. \n\nAdditional Instructions: \n- Root Location encase you need it will be /opt/apps/sadd/\n- Should be a docker build\n- I want to be able to have a GitHub Repo set up for it will an auto rebuild and deploy system when something new is pushed to the Repo.\n- this app shouldn’t used Paid things. The goal is to be free minus the hosting I do from my own server. \n- map feature on the coordinators page (/dashboard) should use OpenStreetMap. \n- Authentication/ Login system is needed, locked pages will be specified below.\n- When you login it should automatically route you to your roles primary page, but only when you initially login, I should still be able to route to the other pages such as homepage or anywhere else I want without being redirected once I login. Here are the default pages for each role. (Admin -> /executives, Coordinator -> /dashboard, Truck Commander (should be abbreviated to TC) -> /driving, Rider -> /request)\n- Things we want to track for pickups: Ride ID [automatically assigned by the system], Rider’s first and last name, driver for the ride [First and Last Name], coordinator that assigned the ride[First and last name], additional it should track the time the request was entered, the time the person got picked up, the time the person was dropped off, along with where the person was picked up at. \n\nUI/UX Requirements: The entire website should use Tailwind for a modern design and easy way to have a cohesive design across all pages. The most important thing is that the design is EXTREMELY mobile friendly as the vast majority of uses will be using this on the phone. All design instructions I provided are in terms of a desktop layout, you will have to determine the mobile layout. Additionally it should be designed in such a way to mock iOS26, the \"Glass Design Inspiration\" and feel like a native app on apple devices.

The next 4 sections will include the different “pages” within the admin page, I don’t want to actually load to a different page just show different things on the page when you click each one.\n- Dashboard: This should show general program analytics, Total Pickups,  Average Pickup Times, Average Drop off Times, Cancelation/No show rate, Average Ride Ratings, section should also include the button for making SADD active or inactive which in turn will change the banner on the homepage. Also when SADD is inactive it shouldn’t allow users to submit ride requests. Also you can add anything you think we might need or will be beneficial on the dashboard.\n- Analytics: This section is big. I want to be able to reset the ride information so it resets our overall statistics. This should be protected behind a confirmation popup that requires you to type. “Yes I want to completely reset the ride analytics.” I also want to be able to see total pickups for the year, pickups by month chart, pickups by location chart, average pickup times, average drop off times. It should show what the “hotspots” are. Show when we are “most active” or most likely to receive requests. Im open to other analytics that you think would be good to know because im sure im not thinking of everything. The design of this page is also up to you just make sure everything is logical and easily read. \n- Users: In this section I want to be able to see all my users within the website. I should be able to edit the users, their personal information, account role, and reset their password if needed. Additional there should be a filter/search area at the top. I should be able to search users or filter by role. Ideally this isn’t a forever scroll design instead it should show like 10-25 accounts and then have pages you can go to within it.\n- Fleet: This area will be where you can view and manage your van fleet. When adding to you fleet it should add for a name a total number of passengers. This number does NOT include the staff in the van, it only includes additional the number of pick you can pick up within the vehicle.  You should also be able to edit and delete the vans and put them in different statuses such as forcing them in maintenance which makes it so they can’t be assigned to drivers.\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

I need you to build me one cmd that will build my entire SADD PWA. If you are needing things to be done manual such as adding in the cloud flare tunnel key then do as much as you can in the one command give explicit instructions on what I need to do then continue with another one cmd to complete the project. I will be self hosting it on a Ubuntu LTS Server that is locally hosted and will need to use cloudflare tunnel due to using Starlink for my WiFi. All passwords should be auto generated when possible, then show me where I can go get those passwords from, unless it’s something you can generate like the cloud flare tunnel one you’ll need. Below will be the additional instructions, site map, functions of each page and the website, and instructions for UI/UX. \n\nAdditional Instructions: \n- Root Location encase you need it will be /opt/apps/sadd/\n- Should be a docker build\n- I want to be able to have a GitHub Repo set up for it will an auto rebuild and deploy system when something new is pushed to the Repo.\n- this app shouldn’t used Paid things. The goal is to be free minus the hosting I do from my own server. \n- map feature on the coordinators page (/dashboard) should use OpenStreetMap. \n- Authentication/ Login system is needed, locked pages will be specified below.\n- When you login it should automatically route you to your roles primary page, but only when you initially login, I should still be able to route to the other pages such as homepage or anywhere else I want without being redirected once I login. Here are the default pages for each role. (Admin -> /executives, Coordinator -> /dashboard, Truck Commander (should be abbreviated to TC) -> /driving, Rider -> /request)\n- Things we want to track for pickups: Ride ID [automatically assigned by the system], Rider’s first and last name, driver for the ride [First and Last Name], coordinator that assigned the ride[First and last name], additional it should track the time the request was entered, the time the person got picked up, the time the person was dropped off, along with where the person was picked up at. \n\nUI/UX Requirements: The entire website should use Tailwind for a modern design and easy way to have a cohesive design across all pages. The most important thing is that the design is EXTREMELY mobile friendly as the vast majority of uses will be using this on the phone. All design instructions I provided are in terms of a desktop layout, you will have to determine the mobile layout. Additionally it should be designed in such a way to mock iOS26, the \"Glass Design Inspiration\" and feel like a native app on apple devices.

It also should have links to the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer.\n\nRider Page: \n- Navigation Bar: Must include \"SADD\" somewhere a Login button when logged in I want it to display the person's name then provide a drop down when hovered or clicked on that shows \"Profile\" and \"Log Out\". Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Request Form: This form will require pick up location, drop off location, and the number of passengers. There will also be an option block that has “notes” and then a “Submit Request” button. With the pickup location I want a way to automatically use the users current location, but also give them the option to input a manual address. When entering an address it should provide address recommendations like it does on google maps or apple maps as you are typing the address. It should also but able to use location names if its a known business. Once the user has requested the ride it should show a “status” card and remove the request form. This will show them the status of their request such as Pending, Accepted, Driver in Route, Passenger Picked Up, Passenger Dropped Off. Once the passenger gets dropped off it should then hide the “status card” and show a “Review Card”. In this review card it will ask for 1-5 stars. If they choose 4 or 5 stars it should prompt them to submit an ICE Comment which is the following link: https://ice.disa.mil/index.cfm?fa=card&sp=86951&s=360&dep=*DoD if they choose 1-3 stars it should prompt the user to send an email using their default email app to fortwainwrightboss@army.mil. If its possible it should auto populate the Ride ID in the email and the subject should auto populate as SADD Ride Comment “RIDE ID”. If the user reloads the page or leaves and comes back after the ride has completed the review portion should be hidden. Additionally below the request form I want to show the last 3 rides the user had if they had any.\n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

Profile links to the profile page for users to edit the profile while log out will log out the user. Then should have a menu to the left of the \"Profile\" section. That menu should only show the pages the role can access. This can exclude the TOS, Privacy Policy, and Become a Volunteer Pages.\n- Should have a toggle/button that will allow the TC to become “active” and then is assigned a Van. If a van isn’t available then they aren’t able to go “online.” When they go online it should require there location to be shared and have notifications turned on because whenever a task gets assigned to them there should be a push notification sent to the users device. Once they go online there should be a “tasks” card that appears. In this task card it will show them their current task with a button to complete the task. For example when a task gets assigned it will pop up with a button for them to mark that they are “on the way to the passenger.” (This should send a push notification to the rider who requested the ride). Then when they arrive at the location they should be able to click the button for “arrived.” Etc. When they are arrived it should show that passengers information (First and Last Name) and provide a call button to use their native phone app to call the rider to let them know they are there. In this menu before they have pickup the passenger there should be a way to add “walk on passengers” This form would require a first and last name, phone number, and drop off location. This automatically would assign this task to the TC and would reshuffle the mapping of the tasks to ensure an optimized drop off or pickup order. There also should be a button to make the ride as a “no show” and mark the ride as canceled and move on to the next assignment/task. Then once the passenger shows they would click “picked up passenger” and stop to either their next task of picking up the next rider and it would automatically but marked as “enroute.” Its important that they have the information at the right time to be able to map to the rider. Ideally the when they get the map button it uses their native map app to give them directions to where they are going. If they don’t have additional riders to pick up it shows the drop off location with a map button/icon to map them to the drop off location. Once they have dropped off the person they are able to click “Dropped Off Passenger” and it marks the ride as complete. \n- Footer: Should include © 2025 Arctic Aura Designs, Soldiers Against Drunk Driving, Built by Arctic Aura Designs (with a link to https://arcticauradesigns.com), and Not Endorsed by the United States Army.

I need to provide a single command that sets up the entire PWA, which includes Docker, the database, backend, frontend, authentication, roles, real-time features, maps, push notifications, and routing, as well as Tailwind and dark mode. I also need to incorporate Cloudflare Tunnel integration for Starlink, along with GitHub repo autopull/deploy. It's important not to start the dev server right now but create the necessary scripts instead."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Exploring command options**\n\nI'm considering how to craft a single bash command that can fetch a bootstrap script from GitHub or their repo; however, we lack external hosting. I could suggest using a curl command with bash -c \"$(curl ...)\" to execute it, but we don’t own a URL. Instead, I could use a one-liner that employs bash heredoc to create the necessary files for a dockerized app, but that's pretty large and cumbersome. I wonder if a simpler command using a base64 gzipped tarball might work, despite the size."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Planning project setup and automation**\n\nConsidering the constraints, I can build the project files in /home/vibecode/workspace and create a \"one cmd\" for their Ubuntu server, like using curl to fetch scripts. However, since we can't host anything, another option is to instruct the user to push the workspace to their GitHub repo. Then, they can run a command to clone the repo and execute the installation script. Also, to enable auto rebuild and deployment, I could set up a GitHub Actions workflow for Docker images and implement Watchtower for updates."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Integrating project components**\n\nI’m considering using GitHub Actions to build and push to GHCR while employing Ouroboros or Watchtower on the server to manage updates and restart containers. There's also the need for Cloudflare Tunnel integration, which requires a token to be pasted into a .env file or created as a secret in GitHub. Since the user wants auto-generated passwords, I can generate a .env with secure random values. Additionally, for geocoding, Nominatim can be used, but heavy usage could be restricted, so I'll consider MapLibre GL and Photon for tiles and geocoding instead."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Developing project requirements**\n\nSince the user is self-hosting, we can utilize free APIs like Geocode.maps.co or LocationIQ, but we should also consider using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim with proper usage guidelines. For routing, options include OSRM or OpenRouteService, each needing API keys, and we might go with a public demo for OSRM despite potential limitations. We can self-host Postgres in Docker for authentication and use JWT tokens with a role-based approach. Our tech stack could center on Next.js for the PWA, with a Dockerfile that includes services like the web app, the database, and possibly Redis for scaling notifications. We'll also create an installer script for setup, ensuring we provide the user a straightforward command to
